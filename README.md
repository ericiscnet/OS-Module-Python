# OS-Module-Python
Using os module in python
The os module in python provides a mechanism to interact with the operating system
It allows the user to create/delete directories, create/delete/modify files and file content and so on.
The module also allows changing/removing of file/directory from one path to another.
In this project, we create a directory named "aws"
We also create two files named "aws-restart" and "aws_copy". We then write into the files and go on to try and read the content in our files.
We display both the created files in the directory as well as the contents of each of the files.
